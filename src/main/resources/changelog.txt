    Plugin now starting on STARTUP to fix strange Brigadier issue when it loads before some other plugins.

    Fixed /execute psudo feature for 1.19.4 by dropping the Commodore usage (directly Brigadier now).
    Fixed some weird errors on uncommon Minecraft versions.
    Dropped Aikar's timings on Paper with psudoasop since it is now deprecated.

1.0.31
    Updated for 1.19.3.

1.0.30
    Added command /psudoasconsole that basically does the same thing as /psudoas but the console replaces all senders.
    The command /psudoasconsole <command> replaces the old /psudoas console <command>.

1.0.29
    Support execute vanilla command with psudo. The old behavior with only psudo still works, except for psudoas.
    The equivalent to "psudoas <target> <command>" is now "execute as <target> at @s run psudoas <command>".

    With execute, selector @s now depends on the last "as" of the execute command, like in vanilla. For coordinates,
    (e.g. ~ ~ ~ or [distance=]), it depends on the last "at" of the execute command, also the same as vanilla behavior.
    If such an "at" or "as" is not specified, the sender of the command is taken.

    To make someone run the command after psudo, this should be psudoas, not psudo, and this person must be selected
    in the last "as" of execute command. This does not work if the selected entity has not the permission to
    run the commande or if it is a mobs. In general, it is better to keep psudo or psudouuid if the plugin command
    supports UUIDs.

    New command : psudoasop. Despite the name, this does not give operator to the player. The behavior is the same as
    psudoas (i.e. /execute as <target> run psudoasop <command>) but if the command is a plugin command, the target will
    bypass its permissions set to plugin.yml. If the plugin command checks permissions inside onCommand method, then
    psudoasop will fail if the sender hasn't the permissions and I can't do anything for this, developers should know
    how to link permissions to a command. Be careful with psudoasop, timings don't work for now.

    Don't forget to use psudouuid with mobs to replace the selector by the uuid and not a poor "pig", even with @s !

    Partially based on the other fork https://github.com/Numa-Lab/PsudoCommands
